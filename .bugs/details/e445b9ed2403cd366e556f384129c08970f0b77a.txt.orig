This is a collection of problems connected to quoting.



` ,(+ 1 2) ,(+ 2 3) , : + 4 5

should be equivalent to

`(,(+ 1 2) ,(+ 2 3) ,(+ 4 5))

but gives 

(REPR-QUASIQUOTE-e749c73d-c826-47e2-a798-c16c13cb89dd (unquote (+ 1 2)) (unquote (+ 2 3)) (unquote (+ 4 5))

this works:

` ,(+ 1 2) ,(+ 2 3) : , + 4 5

display ` , : + 1
should give (display `(,(+ 1)))
but gives (display `(,((+ 1))))
